# Changelog

## v0.2.0-alpha
- Shipped: signal/computed/effect/resource primitives; fine-grained DOM bindings with single-run components; lazy computeds; lexical synchronous context; explicit resources with latest-wins and opt-in auto refresh.
- Excluded: memoization helpers, suspense, router, SSR, global stores, form abstractions, styling systems.
- Stability: semantics are frozen under the v0.2 design contract; any semantic change demands a major version, ergonomic tweaks must prove no observable behavior shifts.
